Test Pushing Shit


- What is a Proximity Mine.

It is a Blueprint that has specific Components:
	- a Proximity Type Component that is implementing the IMine interface
	- a ProximityMineFlowComponent that is inheriting the MineFlowComponent, and is overriding specific functions to adapt as a Proximity Mine (assuming it needs to react to any thing close to it)
	- a Collision Component that isn't a HIT collision but only OverlapEnter and Exit

	Extension:
		- New behaviour: EnemyProximityMineFlowComponent inheriting from ProximityMineFlowComponent, and override the function determining if it needs to react to something overlapping the trigger space, and
		only return true if the entering Actor has a ICharacter type component interface, and if that one is EnemyCharacter.
		- New behaviour: PlayerProximityMineFlowComponent inheriting from ProximityMineFlowComponent, and override the function determining if it needs to react to something overlapping the trigger space, and
		only return true if the entering Actor has a ICharacter type component interface, and if that one is PlayerCharacter.


	We can look at having only a ProximityMine Blueprint where you need to specific the IType to look for, and a potential specific Component (We could define a mine to react to any character,
	then look only for a specific interface, makes it faster)
